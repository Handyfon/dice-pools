<h1>Tension Dice Example </h1>
The Tension Pool is a simple mechanic for tabletop role-playing games that adds rising tension to the game. Players use six standard six-sided dice and a small bowl or container. During slow parts of the game, players can add a die to the Tension Pool whenever they commit to a time-consuming action, and roll the Tension Pool whenever they commit to a reckless action. When the sixth die is added, a complication is introduced. The Tension Pool adds weight to time-wasting and reckless actions and increases players' awareness of in-game time.
