# Dice Pools

Dice Pools is a module designed for tabletop role-playing games that allows players to add custom dice pools and tension mechanics to their game sessions. This module supports a variety of dice types, including d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100.

## Tension Dice

The Tension Pool is a simple and effective mechanic for adding rising tension to any tabletop RPG. Players use six standard six-sided dice and a small bowl or container. During slow parts of the game, players can add a die to the Tension Pool whenever they commit to a time-consuming action, and roll the Tension Pool whenever they commit to a reckless action. When the sixth die is added, a complication is introduced, adding weight to time-wasting and reckless actions and increasing players' awareness of in-game time.

### Creating a DicePool

To create a new DicePool, click the "+" icon. You can define a name, how many dice the pool can hold, and what kind of dice it supports (d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100). You can also choose a color for the pool, and depending on the brightness value of your chosen color, the text will always change to black or white to ensure visibility. You can add as many DicePools as you want.
